            <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
            <p>
                The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts
                they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.<br>
                Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to
                comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.<br>
                In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br>
                We will notify you via email
            <ul>
                <li>Within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>
            We will notify the users via in-site notification
            <ul>
                <li>Within 7 business days</li>
            </ul>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
            against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law.<br>
            This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse
            to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
            </p>
            <h2>CAN SPAM Act</h2>
            <p>
                The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
                messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
                penalties for violations.
